## Log

### Day 1: June 12. Wednesday
<strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Finished freeCodeCamp's "Basic HTML and HTML5" in "Responsive Web Design Certification" section.
<strong>Thoughts:</strong> May not fully remember all the HTML code which I learned today but can understand all the content and the structure. Not sure if I should finish these HTML related classes first or should I work on python.<br>

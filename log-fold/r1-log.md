## Log

### Day 1: June 12. Wednesday
<strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Finished freeCodeCamp's "Basic HTML and HTML5" in "Responsive Web Design Certification" section.
<strong>Thoughts:</strong> May not fully remember all the HTML code which I learned today but can understand all the content and the structure. Not sure if I should finish these HTML related classes first or should I work on python.<br>

<strong>Thoughts:</strong> Yesterday, I found out the rules of the challenge shouldn't be tutorial or copying other people's code. So I'm wondering if practicing the code in freecodecamp is another type of violation. But after I read the article <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645/"> How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year</a>, I decided to stick to this plan still. <br>

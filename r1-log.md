## Log

<h3>Day 1: June 12. Wednesday</h3>
<h4>Today's Progress:</h4>
Finished freeCodeCamp's "Basic HTML and HTML5" in "Responsive Web Design Certification" section.

<h4>Thoughts:</h4>
May not fully remember all the HTML code which I learned today but can understand all the content and the structure. Not sure if I should finish these HTML related classes first or should I work on python.
